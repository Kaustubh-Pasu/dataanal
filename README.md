### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code
1. Open your web browser and search for **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Click on the official website and download it for your computer.
3. Once the download is complete, open and install Visual Studio Code.
4. After installing, open Visual Studio Code.
5. On the left side of the screen, you’ll see an icon for **Extensions** (it looks like a square with four small boxes inside). Click on it.
6. In the search bar at the top of the Extensions panel, search for and install the following extensions:
   - **Python**
   - **GitLens**
   - **GitHub Pull Requests**

### Step 2: Install Python
1. Open your web browser and search for **Python**.
2. Click on the official Python website and download the latest version for your operating system.
3. After downloading, open and install Python, making sure to check the box that says “Add Python to PATH” during the installation process.

### Step 3: Install Pip
1. Open your web browser and search for **Pip install**.
2. Follow the instructions on the Python website to install **pip** (pip is a tool for installing other Python libraries).

### Step 4: Set Up Your Project (Code Configuration)
1. Open **Command Prompt** (search for "Command Prompt" in your computer's search bar).
2. Type the following commands one by one and press Enter after each one to install some tools you’ll need for the project:
   ```
   pip install pandas
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install seaborn
   pip install tkinter
   pip install mplcursors
   ```

3. Create a new folder on your computer where you want to store your project files. You can name it anything you like.
4. Open **Visual Studio Code** again.
5. In Visual Studio Code, click **File** > **Open Folder**, and select the folder you just created.
6. In Visual Studio Code, on the left side of the screen, find and click on **Source Control** (it looks like a branching tree icon).
7. Click **Initialize Repository**.
8. After that, open the **Terminal** in Visual Studio Code by going to **Terminal** > **New Terminal**.
9. In the terminal, type this command and press Enter:
   ```
   git pull https://github.com/Kaustubh-Pasu/dataanal
   ```

### Step 5: Edit the File Path
1. In Visual Studio Code, open the file called **main.py** (this is the code file that runs the program).
2. Inside **main.py**, you’ll need to **change the file location for the CSV file**. This means you should update the code to point to where the CSV file is saved on your computer. (The file location should be something like `C:/Users/YourName/Downloads/data.csv` or wherever you saved the file.)
